# Justen Cate - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
I'm Justen, a data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights.  I've honed my skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and data visualization through academic projects, professional certificates, and work experience.

I'm always eager to learn new techniques and tools, and I'm excited to apply my knowledge to solve complex problems. I'm a collaborative team player, and I'm equally comfortable working independently.

This repository showcases my projects and skills in data analysis. Feel free to explore!
