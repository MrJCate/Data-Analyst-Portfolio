# Justen Cate - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Justen! I have developed a strong foundation and passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analyst as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
